# 📊 HR Employee Attrition Prediction & Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end machine learning and analytics project designed to predict employee attrition and provide actionable HR insights through an interactive managerial dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Employee attrition is one of the most critical challenges in human resource management.
This project combines **data analytics**, **machine learning**, and **interactive visualization** to:

* Predict employee resignation probability
* Identify high-risk employees
* Estimate financial impact of turnover
* Support data-driven HR decision making

The system is implemented using **Streamlit** to provide an intuitive managerial dashboard.
